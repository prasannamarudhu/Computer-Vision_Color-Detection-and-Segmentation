# Computer-Vision_Color-Detection-and-Segmentation
 Developed an algorithm for segmenting objects from an image based on color using Python 3.0 and OpenCV. The task was to count the number of objects with the same color (i.e. "five blue pins" or "two red candies", etc.) and output it as text overlayed on the original image.

The python program file can be run to visualize the output.
